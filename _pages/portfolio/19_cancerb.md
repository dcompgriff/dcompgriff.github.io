## Problem: 
* Detecting whether or not a cell is cancerous is of vital importance to medical practitioners. Many times the data gathered about the cells of a tumor are not easily human readable, and have complicated relationships. The question is, how can we use statistically data driven methods to determine if a particular sample cell is cancerous?

## Solution: 
* Develop a supervised classification model to predict the likelihood of a given cell from a tumor to be malignant or benign. 

## Methods:
* Custom random forest implementation, and a TAN Bayesian network.

## Frameworks and Platforms:
* Python, custom modeling code

## Outcomes:
* Developed a cancer classification system with over 90% accuracy in classifying cells as malignant or not.
