## Problem: 
* Coaches typically have to balance between the need to train their athletes to peak physical condition and the need for athletes to rest and recuperate. Too much physical conditioning can start to have a negative effect on overall performance and can lead to higher risk of disabling injuries. On the other hand, not enough training can lead to game losses. Coaches need to know the current health status of their players, and players need a set of measured suggestions for meals, exercise, and activity to maximize performance while keeping the risk of injury under a pre-set threshold.

## Solution: 
* Develop a predictive and prescriptive mobile application that would gather health data, predict performance metrics and injury risks, and prescribe activity and rest levels to maximize performance.

## Methods:
* Classical machine learning models, optimization methods

## Frameworks and Platforms:
* Java, android mobile apps, etcâ€¦

## Outcomes:
* Developed a mobile phone app that would connect to and track health sensor data and would predict and prescribe activity and rest cycles for preventing injury and maximizing performance.
